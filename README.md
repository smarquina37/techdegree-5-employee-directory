This app is for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. We wanted to use data from Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/)to grab the information for 12 random employees and use that data to build an employee directory.

First, I requested a JSON object from the API and parsed the data to display the 12 employees on the screen with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location.

Then, I created a modal that pops up when a user clicks anywhere pn the employee’s card. This new window has more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
